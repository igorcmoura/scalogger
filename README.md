# Scalogger

Frogger game made in Scala for the Programming Language Models class at UFRGS.

## How to run

There are two projects, an object oriented one and a functional one.
[SBT](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) is used to manage them, install it and, inside the project's directory run...

```bash
sbt "project objectOriented" run
```

...to run the object oriented project.

Or...

```bash
sbt "project functional" run
```

...to run the functional project.

**PS: The functional version is not working yet.**
